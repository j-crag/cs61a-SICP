"""Question 5
Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach,
poses the following mathematical puzzle.

Pick a positive integer n as the start.
If n is even, divide it by 2.
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
Continue this process until n is 1.
The number n will travel up and down but eventually end at 1
(at least for all numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody 
has ever proved that the sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down
in the atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.


This sequence of values of n is often called a Hailstone sequence.
Write a function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name n,
prints out the hailstone sequence starting at n, and returns the number of steps in the sequence:
